<h2>The five machine learning models used are:</h2>
GradientBoosting <br>
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) <br>
LogisticRegression <br>
RandomForest<br>
SVM (Support Vector Machine)<br>

<h2>The five sampling techniques used are:</h2>
ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)<br>
BorderlineSMOTE (Borderline SMOTE)<br>
RandomOverSampling<br>
RandomUnderSampling<br>
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)<br>

<h2>Result</h2>
Based on the provided TOPSIS scores, it appears that the GradientBoosting model achieved the highest scores across all sampling techniques. Therefore, the best model in this analysis is GradientBoosting.
