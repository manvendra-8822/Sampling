<h2>The five machine learning models used are:</h2>
GradientBoosting
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
LogisticRegression
RandomForest
SVM (Support Vector Machine)

<h2>The five sampling techniques used are:</h2>
ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)
BorderlineSMOTE (Borderline SMOTE)
RandomOverSampling
RandomUnderSampling
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

<h2>Result</h2>
Based on the provided TOPSIS scores, it appears that the GradientBoosting model achieved the highest scores across all sampling techniques. Therefore, the best model in this analysis is GradientBoosting.
